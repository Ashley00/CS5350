# CS5350
This is a machine learning library developed by Ashley Lan for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

Include run.sh to start the program for each folder


#### For HW1-DecisoinTree:
Call ID3(S, Attribute, Label, splitName, columns, maxDepth, currDepth) to learn Decision Tree.\
S-whole data set\
Attribute-whole attributes, a dictonary including values for each attribute\
Label-a list contains all possible labels\
splitName-type of information gain we can have: "Entropy", "MajorityError", or "GiniIndex"\
columns-a list contains all columns header\
maxDepth-int of max depth for the tree\
currDepth-int of current depth for the tree

#### For HW2-:
My program for running ensemble learning takes a longer time than expected.
